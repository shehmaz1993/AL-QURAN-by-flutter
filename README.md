There is an option named "Read mode" by which they will be able to read only the arabic verses of surah. An advantageous feature has been implemented to choose the font size of the words according to readers will. Readers can scroll particular verse of a surah and navigate to that verse of that surah in quick navigation page. Not only that, anyone can copy or bookmark that specific verse by clicking the copy or bookmark button. Apart from that, user can also copy manually by prerssing the verse on the screen. Serach box has been added to search verses which contains particular word or multiple words typed by reader. While typing, some suggestions of those verses are shown which directs to that verses by pressing to that particular verse.On the other hand, if reader clicks the serach button,all the lis of  related verses, containing that word or words, are shown in searched page.
